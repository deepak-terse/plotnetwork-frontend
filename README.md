# PlotNetwork (Front-end)

A comprehensive platform tailored for real estate administrators, brokers, and their sales teams to efficiently manage microsites, leads, and team activities.


## About the Project

Developed as a proof of concept for a client during my freelance tenure, this project aimed to swiftly deliver a minimum viable product (MVP), conduct user acceptance testing within the internal team, and pilot it with a partner to assess product effectiveness. Upon successful evaluation, the plan was to scale the platform to additional partners.

Over a 6-month engagement, the platform expanded to serve 5 partners, accommodating over 150 users including brokers and sales teams, and handling 500+ daily incoming leads.

During the project, I crafted a UI template to expedite development. Further details can be found below:


## React UI Templates

- It was designed to simplify and speed up development of modules with CRUD operations

- Developed two versatile templates:
  - **Grid Page**: featuring data listing with pagination, filters, and options for update and delete operations.
  - **Side Panel**: displaying add/update forms with validations.

- Configured all these functionalities and styles using JSON configurations, facilitating swift integration of new modules without additional coding.

- This approach significantly reduced development time for adding new modules and undertaking subsequent projects.

- Future plans involve streamlining and automating common development operations further.
